// A recipe: a named whole-drink specification (openspec change add-recipes).
// A profile tells the machine how to push water; a recipe holds the drink —
// profile, bean link, equipment, dose/yield/temp, its own grind, and steam.
// Recipes follow the optionality ladder: only name + profile are required;
// bean and equipment links are optional and a recipe works with whatever
// rungs exist.
//
// Grind: always the recipe's own (fix-recipe-grind-integrity — the old
// "empty grindPinned = inherit from the bag" mode is retired; migration 30
// backfilled inherit-mode rows from their bag). grindPinned is this recipe's
// own opaque grind text, rpmPinned rides with it. The linked bag's dial is
// read exactly once, at creation, as the field's editable default (the
// wizard offers it; requestCreateRecipe adopts it when a bag-linked create
// map OMITS grind — an explicitly empty grind stays empty). Grind-less drink
// types (tea) store none.
//
// Steam: steamJson holds the drink's steam block, serialized as
// {hasMilk, milkWeightG, pitcherName, durationSec, flow, temperatureC}. The
// pitcher is snapshotted BY VALUE (name + duration/flow/temperature) — never a
// preset-list reference — per the Bean Base snapshot-not-reference rule.
//
// Hot water: hotWaterJson holds the drink's added-hot-water block (for an
// Americano), serialized as {hasWater, vesselName, volume, mode, flowRate,
// temperatureC, order}. order is "after" (americano, default) or "before"
// (long black). Hot water is opt-in — hasWater toggles it on and the user
// selects a water vessel; the vessel's own values ride the recipe. Like
// the steam pitcher the vessel is snapshotted BY VALUE (never a preset-list
// reference); activation re-selects it by name and recreates it from the
// snapshot if the preset was deleted. There is no separate per-recipe amount.
// Returned by the recipes-using-a-profile count when the count could not be
// taken at all. Distinct from 0 on purpose — see countRecipesUsingProfile.
