    // the engine at scope unwind"). That has since been fixed — the declaration
    // now sits above the engine — so the specific crash below is no longer
    // reachable at app exit. This stays because it is the second line of
    // defence, and because it still covers the runtime recreate path (a new
    // device discovered while one is live) that ordering does nothing for.
    //
    // What the ordering bug looked like, so nobody reintroduces it: the device
    // died while the engine and every binding reading
    // `BLEManager.refractometerConnected` were still live: ~QObject emits
    // destroyed(), QML drops the `Refractometer` context property, and the
    // resulting binding re-evaluation lands in isRefractometerConnected() on an
    // object whose derived part is already gone. Through a raw pointer, that
    // call is a pure-virtual dispatch on a vptr already rewound to QObject's:
    // it indexes past the end of QObject's vtable into adjacent data and jumps
    // there. On macOS/arm64 that was a SIGBUS instruction-abort with the PC
    // inside QtCore's non-executable __DATA; other platforms may land on a
    // plausible-looking pointer and not trap at all, so "no crash here" is not
    // evidence the fault is gone.
    //
    // Why QPointer answers it: ~QObject stores 0 into sharedRefcount->strongref
    // before the `emit destroyed(this)` a few lines below (qtbase qobject.cpp,
    // verified against Qt 6.11.1), so the pointer already reads null when that
    // binding runs and the getter just reports "not connected".
    //
    // Bound worth knowing: this only covers the window from ~QObject onward. A
    // signal emitted from a concrete driver's OWN destructor body would still
    // find a non-null QPointer and a half-destroyed object. That window is
    // empty today — neither transport emits synchronously from
    // disconnectFromDevice() — but it is not something QPointer protects.
    QPointer<RefractometerDevice> m_refractometerDevice;

    // Handles for the two connections setRefractometerDevice() installs, so it
    // can sever exactly those. It must NOT use a blanket
    // disconnect(device, nullptr, this, nullptr): main.cpp also connects the
    // device's errorOccurred to our errorOccurred, and that has to survive until
    // the device is actually destroyed. Forget nulls the holder BEFORE disconnecting the device (that
    // order is load-bearing — see the timer-stop note on
    // disconnectRefractometerRequested in main.cpp), so a blanket disconnect
    // there silently swallowed every log line the disconnect itself produced.
