## Context

This change comes from a code read of v2.0.8 (`main` at 91f1e7d, Oct 2026): 258 QML files, about 103k lines. It covered:

- the daily brew loop;
- the profile, recipe, bean and equipment screens;
- settings, first run and error flows;
- the theme and visual system;
- package size and runtime responsiveness.

Contrast figures are computed from the default palettes in `settings_theme.cpp`. Package sizes are measured from the v2.0.8 release APK's zip directory. Nothing was measured on a device, so every runtime finding below is a pointer to code to confirm, not a measured defect. Line numbers are as of 91f1e7d.

The reference point is the Meticulous machine's own screen ([usage manual](https://meticuloushome.com/pages/usage-manual)). It is not a feature model, because Decenza is far more capable. It shows how small an everyday surface can be:

- Pick a profile, then "Hold to start".
- While brewing: one pressure needle, four numbers and the current stage name.
- At the end: weight, time and "remove cup". The graph is one turn of the dial away.
- Errors carry one action ("Tap to retry").
- A ten-item menu, with Advanced settings and factory reset at the bottom.
- Profile building and setup live in the phone app.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals**
- The everyday path takes two taps or fewer, and every affordance on it is visible.
- No dead ends: every problem message offers a way forward.
- Nothing covers a running shot.
- The screen is legible at arm's length, in both shipped themes, for any finger size.
- A user can predict where a setting lives.
- The package carries only what the app uses, and optional features cost nothing until they are switched on.
- No visible stall on the reference tablet when opening a page or finishing a shot.

**Non-Goals**
- Removing features or power-user paths. Gestures stay available as opt-in through the existing gesture-override system.
- Renaming "bag" (decided in #1993) or collapsing the multi-page recipe wizard (decided in #1610).
- Any BLE protocol, profile-engine or database schema change.
- Copying Meticulous's look.

## Decisions

### D1: One obvious start
Selecting and starting are different acts and must look different. The selected pill shows ▶, or "Press group head" when a GHC owns the start. A start the app refuses always says why.

### D2: A running machine owns the screen
`operationActive` already exists (`main.qml:403`). Notices raised during an operation queue exactly as they do for the screensaver.

### D3: Every problem message has one way forward
Each problem message gets a button that fixes the problem, or a button that goes to where it can be fixed, named as the destination is actually named.

### D4: Show the result, then the next step
After a shot, the first thing on screen is the result and a fast rating. Everything else is one tap down. This follows Meticulous's green end screen.

### D5: Three tiers: everyday, set once, advanced
Settings and editors show the first two tiers by default. Advanced items sit behind one remembered switch and stay searchable.

### D6: One word, one meaning
"Favorites", "recipe" and the star icon each name exactly one thing.

### D7: Legible and hittable regardless of window size or theme
Window scaling may shrink drawing, but not hit areas below `Theme.touchTargetMin`. Contrast is checked for every shipped theme, graphs included.

### D8: Measure first, and state the win in what the user feels
Every Phase 5 item starts with a number on the reference tablet, using the existing `PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md` protocol extended with cold start, page-open time and a main-thread lag probe. Each item ends with the same number again: "Steam opens in X ms instead of Y", "the APK is N MB smaller". An item that does not move a number the user notices is dropped, as `CLAUDE.md` asks.

### D9: Optional features pay their own way
A feature that most users leave off (remote MCP, video and 3D screensavers, TTS) should not add download size or startup work for everyone else. It gets a separate build, an on-demand load, or a lighter path.

## Findings

Effort: S = hours, M = days, L = a week or more.

### A. Home screen and daily brew loop

| ID | Finding | Evidence | Proposal | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Update, charging and scale notices are deferred for the screensaver (scale notices also wait for wake), never for a running operation. They can open over a shot or steaming | `main.qml:2304-2306`, `:2065-2071`, `:1794-1796`; `operationActive` (`:403`) gates only the auto-sleep and auto-load timers | Queue while `machineOperating` (the operation phases and steam warm-up, not a firmware flash) | S |
| A2 | The "Shot Stopped" dialog (shot aborted, saved scale missing) sends users to "Settings → Bluetooth", which does not exist (the tab is "Connections"). The only workaround it offers is forgetting the scale. All three scale dialogs offer only OK | `main.qml:1986-1990`, `:1871-1880`, `:1930-1939`; `SettingsTabs.qml:18` | Reconnect / Open Connections / brew once without scale | S–M |
| A3 | A second tap on the selected pill starts the shot, with no visual cue. When the machine is not ready the tap logs, and announces only in accessibility mode. A recipe re-tap blocked by a GHC only logs | `IdlePage.qml:490-513`, `:1127-1140`; `RecipesItem.qml:49-69`; `PresetPillRow.qml:458-486` | ▶ on the selected pill; visible reason toast | S |
| A4 | The seven action tiles (Recipes, Beans, Steam, Hot Water, Flush, Espresso, Equipment) reserve a double-tap by default, so each single tap waits 300 ms (outside accessibility mode) | `settings_network.cpp:894-904`, `LayoutItemDelegate.qml:309-317`, `CustomItem.qml:501`, `AccessibleTapHandler.qml:141-148` | No default double-tap; long-press opens the page | S |
| A5 | Holding Sleep quits the app (`allowQuit` defaults to true). An ungated 80×80 area: holding the top-right corner for 5 s saves a "[Simulated shot]" into real history and clears the current DYE notes/TDS/EY | `SleepItem.qml:17`, `:84-108`; `IdlePage.qml:43-78`; `maincontroller.cpp:4858-5001` | A confirmation before any in-app quit (the default must stay: it is the only exit in the built-in layouts); fake-shot corner only in debug or simulation builds | S |
| A6 | Fresh install: "Espresso" appears nowhere on the home screen (the espresso widget sits in the bottom bar as "Profiles"). With zero recipes, tapping Recipes opens an empty row with no hint. A starter recipe is only made for upgrading users who accept the offer | `settings_network.cpp:321-340`, `EspressoItem.qml:147-149`, `maincontroller.cpp:2134-2135` | Empty state "+ New recipe / Brew with <profile>" | S–M |
| A7 | Bottom-bar popups close after selecting, so switch-and-brew takes four taps | `EspressoItem.qml:293`, `RecipesItem.qml:342`, `SteamItem.qml:246` | Keep open until start or an outside tap | S |
| A8 | "Heating" uses the error colour. Machine status cannot be tapped | `MachineStatusItem.qml:26-29`, `:106`, `:150` | Warning colour plus target; tap to reconnect | S–M |
| A9 | The post-shot review shows about 35 controls. Rating buttons are 36×28 with 12 px text, under `touchTargetMin` (44). Auto-close defaults to Never | `RatingInput.qml:100-119`, `Theme.qml:1042`, `PostShotReviewPage.qml:390` | Quick-rate card first, rest under Details | M |
| A10 | The Espresso page back arrow (and Esc, Space, Backspace) stops the shot. The STOP button is shown only on headless machines. Skip-step is the same button style as ±5/±10 g and sits right next to them | `EspressoPage.qml:119-127`, `:620-626`, `:703-752`, `:1011-1066` | A red "Stop"; a distinct, spaced Skip | S |
| A11 | The stop-reason banner (shown after every shot) is four hard-coded English strings, with text colour "black" | `main.qml:2506-2513`, `:2564-2568` | Translate; show the result | S |
| A12 | Six hand-rolled toasts share one position and layer, at 13 px | `main.qml:4763-5053`, `StatusToast.qml:49` | One queued toast at body size | S |

### B. Profiles, recipes, beans, equipment

| ID | Finding | Evidence | Proposal | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | The idle "Favorites" widget (star icon) opens Auto-Favorites. The same word and star mark starred profiles | `AutoFavoritesItem.qml:37-63`, `ProfileCard.qml:182-191`, `ProfilePicker.qml:458-464` | Rename Auto-Favorites; give it its own icon | S |
| B2 | The profile editor says "recipe": a new D-Flow profile is titled "D-Flow / New Recipe", and leaving it asks about "unsaved changes to this recipe" (the noun is inserted untranslated) | `ProfileSelectorPage.qml:214-216`, `RecipeEditorPage.qml:697`, `UnsavedChangesDialog.qml:71` | "Profile" throughout; translate the item noun | S |
| B3 | Dose, yield, grind and equipment are editable on the recipe, the bag and the profile, with a precedence the user cannot see | `ChangeBeansDialog.qml:2428-2539`, `RecipeWizardPage.qml:2787-2917`, `docs/CLAUDE_MD/RECIPES.md` | Provenance tag per value in Brew Settings | M |
| B4 | Changing the profile, bag, equipment, pitcher or vessel deactivates the active recipe silently (six swap watchers among 13 call sites). No QML reacts to `activeRecipeChanged` | `maincontroller.cpp:2695`; watchers at `:1699`, `:1729`, `:1752`, `:1850`, `:1857`, `:1893` | Toast plus restore | S |
| B5 | "Edit" loads the profile onto the machine before the editor opens. Just inspecting a profile changes the active profile and drops the active recipe (B4). Edits themselves upload on exit (Try/Save) | `ProfilePicker.qml:719-722`; `RecipeEditorPage.qml:174-187`, `:706-707` | Open the editor without loading; load on Try/Save | M |
| B6 | Which editor opens depends on the title prefix ("D-Flow / "). Rename prefills the whole title selected, so typing replaces the prefix and silently changes the editor. `convertCurrentProfileToAdvanced` / `switchToAdvancedEditor` have no UI caller | `main.qml:4067-4080`, `ProfilePicker.qml:995-999`, `:1074`; `profilemanager.cpp:3495` | Explicit editor type; convert with a warning | M |
| B7 | Profile cards have no curve preview (long-press only), tap loads immediately, and search matches titles only | `ProfileCard.qml:205-258`, `ProfileSelectorPage.qml:64-66` | Sparkline; tap previews, Load commits | M |
| B8 | ValueInput ± buttons are `sc(24)` wide and hold-repeat at a fixed 80 ms. Pressure and flow step by 0.01 (6→9 bar is 300 presses). A faster inline drag exists (20 px per step; drag down for ×10/×100), and so does typing (tap → popup → double-tap), but neither has a visible affordance | `ValueInput.qml:234`, `:269-275`, `:298-404`, `:881-886`; `SimpleProfileEditorPage.qml:456`, `:521` | Keypad toggle, acceleration, 0.1 step, 44+ px | S–M |
| B9 | Wizard temperature is an offset (±°), while tea uses an absolute temperature. Three input styles share one screen | `RecipeWizardPage.qml:2917-2994` | Absolute temperature shown; offset stored | S |
| B10 | One bag dialog has four titles; the Beans page lists bags; tapping an equipment card does not select it | `ChangeBeansDialog.qml:1189-1193`, `EquipmentPage.qml:14` | One title per action; tap to use | M |

### C. Settings, first run, errors

| ID | Finding | Evidence | Proposal | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | 12 release tabs, about 250 controls, grouped by implementation rather than by task. Examples: dark/light lives under Machine; Auto-Sleep under Screensaver; factory reset inside the web-server card; firmware under About | `SettingsTabs.qml:17-31`, `SettingsMachineTab.qml:732`, `SettingsScreensaverTab.qml:314`, `SettingsHistoryDataTab.qml:520-744` | Task-based groups (tasks 3.5) | L |
| C2 | No global advanced tier: heater calibration, raw logs, MAC addresses and Tailscale ACLs sit beside everyday items | `SettingsCalibrationTab.qml:1009-1093`, `SettingsConnectionsTab.qml:974`, `SettingsAITab.qml:1577-1680` | "Show advanced settings" switch | M |
| C3 | First run is one text dialog. Language defaults to "en" whatever the device locale. A never-paired scale is not auto-connected, so new users brew on estimated weight unknowingly | `main.qml:984-986`, `:3153-3175`; `translationmanager.cpp:45` | Four-step skippable onboarding | M |
| C4 | Jargon in tab names and labels: "MQTT", "Lang & Access", "Glass chrome", "Multiplier" | `SettingsTabs.qml:27`, `SettingsPage.qml:180` | Plain names; one-line card descriptions | S |
| C5 | AI provider setup exists on two screens with different wording | `AISettingsPage.qml:62-65`, `SettingsAITab.qml:188` | One screen | S |
| C6 | Settings search indexes 54 cards. Searching "fahrenheit", "celsius" or "units" finds nothing. Nothing checks that the index covers every card | `SettingsSearchIndex.js` | Full index plus a check | S |
| C7 | BLE permission errors are classified by English substrings in an already-translated message, then replaced by untranslated English. In other languages, the dialog loses its "open settings" buttons | `main.qml:1764-1771`, `blemanager.cpp:1230-1288` | Error codes | S |
| C8 | One-tap resets and deletes with no confirmation or undo. Replace-mode restore deletes all shots with no automatic backup | `SettingsCalibrationTab.qml:116`, `SettingsConnectionsTab.qml:1571-1576`, `SettingsThemesTab.qml:396-428` | Confirmation or undo; backup first | S–M |

### D. Visual system and accessibility

| ID | Finding | Evidence | Proposal | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Light theme (no background preset): the plot area is `Qt.darker(white, 1.6)` = #9f9f9f, with hard-coded white grid and axes. Phase labels are 80% white on a #aaaaaa chip. Curves measure 1.1–2.3:1 | `DecenzaGraphsTheme.qml:31-42`, `ShotGraph.qml:446`, `HistoryShotGraph.qml:708` | Light plot background; derive line colours from `textColor` | S |
| D2 | Light theme buttons: primary text #4e85f4 on #d1daee measures 2.5:1; destructive measures 1.36:1 | `settings_theme.cpp:425`, `:471`; `AccessibleButton.qml:69` | Always use `contrastColorFor(fill)` | S |
| D3 | Shot-history "Load" is `primaryContrastColor` on the warning orange: white (1.9:1) in dark, blue in light. It is also a raw Rectangle+MouseArea | `ShotHistoryPage.qml:1045-1061` | Contrast foreground, or a neutral button | S |
| D4 | Quality issues are 8 px dots, the same red for three different problems (orange for grind) | `ShotHistoryPage.qml:1002-1027` | Text badges | S |
| D5 | `Theme.scale` = min(w/960, h/600) with no floor. On a landscape phone it is about 0.69, so ± buttons fall to roughly 16 dp | `main.qml:1039-1046` | A hit-area floor | M |
| D6 | 680 `pixelSize: Theme.scaled(<n>)` sites (22 distinct sizes, 142 at ≤11) bypass the font roles. Core review labels are 10 px, and font-size overrides do not reach them | `PostShotReviewPage.qml:1897` and others | Map onto the roles; add a check | M–L |
| D7 | `Theme.borderColor` on the surface measures 1.35:1, and `StyledComboBox` has no border at rest | `StyledComboBox.qml:44-47` | Control-border token of at least 3:1 | S |
| D8 | Rotated phase labels overlap and hide the curves. The legend does not explain dashed = target | `ShotGraph.qml:409-460`, `HistoryShotGraph.qml:692-716`; fix exists in `ComparisonGraph.qml:505-521` | Port the packing; add a legend key | S |
| D9 | In shot history, tapping a row toggles compare selection. Opening the shot needs a long-press or the small ">" button. With a screen reader the default action opens it | `ShotHistoryPage.qml:1137-1141`, `:1109-1132`, `:790` | Tap opens; a checkbox selects | M |

### E. Weight and responsiveness

The v2.0.8 APK is 218.7 MB for a single ABI (arm64). The figures below were measured by reading the release APK's central directory: 128 native libraries, all stored uncompressed (`legacyPackaging` is off, so Android maps them straight from the APK). Keeping that mode is right, because it gives a smaller installed size. The savings have to come from what goes into the package.

| Contributor | MB | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `libDecenza` (app code, AOT-compiled QML, embedded resources) | 80.6 | everything |
| FFmpeg + Qt Multimedia | 20.1 | video screensaver, two UI sounds |
| `libtailscale` (tsnet) | 18.7 | remote MCP connector, off by default |
| Quick Controls styles other than Material/Basic | 11.5 | nothing (`main.cpp:991` sets Material) |
| Qt Widgets | 7.1 | only `QApplication` (`main.cpp:646`) |
| Quick3D + ShaderTools | 9.3 | two 3D screensavers |
| QML debug plugins (`qmltooling`) | 1.3 | nothing in release |
| Image-format plugins icns/ico/tga/tiff/wbmp | 0.9 | nothing found |

Old Decent tablets are where it hurts:
- lag, and taps landing on the wrong thing (#1976);
- slow wake (#694);
- freezes (#580).

The newest crash report (#2030) is a SIGSEGV inside the JS garbage collector on the main thread during a shot. The repo already has a measurement protocol (`docs/CLAUDE_MD/PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md`, reference tablet SM-X210). Nothing below was profiled on a device, so each runtime item is a mechanism to measure, not a measured cost.

| ID | Finding | Evidence | Proposal | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Four unused Quick Controls styles ship: FluentWinUI3, Fusion, Imagine, Universal and their impl libraries | APK listing; `main.cpp:991` | Exclude them in packaging; keep Material and Basic. **−11.5 MB** | S |
| E2 | Qt Widgets is linked only to construct `QApplication`; no widget class is used | `main.cpp:646`, `CMakeLists.txt:1166` | `QGuiApplication` (at least on Android). **−7.1 MB** | S |
| E3 | The Tailscale Go runtime ships, and loads in every process, for a connector that is off by default | `cmake/tsnet.cmake:123-131`, `settings_mcp.cpp:57` | A separate "remote" build, or load it on demand. **−18.7 MB** | M |
| E4 | FFmpeg ships for the video screensaver and two UI sounds | `ScreensaverPage.qml:436-472`, `accessibilitymanager.cpp:317-329` | Images-only screensaver on Android (also asked in #1979); sounds through the platform backend. **−18 to −20 MB** | M–L |
| E5 | Quick3D and ShaderTools ship for the Pipes and ShotMapGlobe screensavers | APK listing; `CMakeLists.txt:1273` | Exclude them if `libQt6Graphs` does not depend on them (check with `readelf -d`). **−9.3 MB** | S–L |
| E6 | QML debug plugins and unused image formats ship in release | APK listing | Packaging excludes. **−2.2 MB** | S |
| E7 | Five splash PNGs (3.0 MB) are compiled in but referenced nowhere. rcc stores a file compressed only when that saves at least 70%, so most of the 9.6 MB of emoji SVG is stored raw | `resources.qrc:36-40` (no references by grep); `resources/emoji` | Drop the splashes; pass `-threshold 0` to rcc. **Estimated −8 MB** | S |
| E8 | About 62 MB of `libDecenza` is code, including 20k AOT-compiled QML functions, whose steady-state benefit the repo's own analysis puts near zero | `docs/CLAUDE_MD/BUILD_PERFORMANCE.md` | Run bloaty on the unstripped CI artifact, then decide between bytecode-only QML or `-Os` for the generated code. **Estimated −10 to −25 MB** | M |
| E9 | The navigation guard clears with `Qt.callLater`, so taps queued while a page builds land on the new page. This matches "multiple taps get registered wrongly" in #1976 | `main.qml:1185-1197` | Keep the guard until the first `frameSwapped` after the push, and swallow presses until then | S |
| E10 | Operation pages build their hidden views up front. SteamPage builds both its live view and its settings view (6 ValueInputs); Hot Water and Flush do the same, and the recipe wizard builds all 5 steps | `SteamPage.qml:603-2240`, `RecipeWizardPage.qml:2295` | `Loader { active: … }` (synchronous: asynchronous incubation is avoided on purpose, see `SettingsPage.qml:250-255`) | S–M |
| E11 | Startup builds about 26 dialogs eagerly: BrewDialog → ChangeBeansDialog is about 4k lines, and the Linux-only BLE dialogs are built on Android too. `Theme.scale` starts at 1.0 and is set afterwards, so 4.8k `Theme.scaled()` bindings evaluate twice | `main.qml:966`, `BrewDialog.qml:726`, `Theme.qml:11` | `OnDemandLoader` for rare dialogs; seed the scale before children evaluate | M |
| E12 | At shot end, analysis, JSON and `qCompress(…, 9)` run on the main thread, just before the review page builds. The never-shown ChangeBeansDialog also runs two DISTINCT queries after every save | `shothistorystorage.cpp:2642-2701`, `:2459`; `ChangeBeansDialog.qml:351-365` | Move the work into the existing `runOnDbThread`, use level 6; only query when the dialog opens | M |
| E13 | The debug log opens, appends to and closes its file for every line, on the calling thread (deliberately: the crash report reads the tail at the next launch). Past 2 MB it reads 2 MB and rewrites 1.6 MB | `webdebuglogger.cpp:328-345`, `:358+` | Measure first. If it costs, one open handle with a flush per line, and trimming off the caller's thread | S–M |
| E14 | Per-sample rebuilds. The four goal curves are rebuilt as full lists on every sample. A custom widget with a machine token builds a new object (~30 closures), runs sanitize, regex and emoji passes and re-lays out RichText at telemetry rate: steady JS garbage on the thread that delivers BLE (#2030) | `shotdatamodel.cpp:266-278`, `:592-595`; `ShotGraph.qml:166-209`; `CustomItem.qml:153-305` | Mark goal curves dirty only on goal/frame change; per-token substitution with cached results | S–M |
| E15 | Always-on costs. TTS is bound even with accessibility off. MemoryMonitor walks the whole QObject tree every 60 s, during shots too. Screensaver photos decode at full resolution (a 12 MP photo is 48 MB) | `accessibilitymanager.cpp:77`; `memorymonitor.cpp:41`; `ScreensaverPage.qml:494-530` | Lazy TTS; monitor every 5 min and never during an operation; set `sourceSize` | S |
| E16 | `setTargetHeapUtilization(0.95)` while the pump runs leaves ART the *least* headroom, the opposite of the comment's intent. `System.gc()` is forced after every shot and every 15 min | `BleHelper.java:30`, `:46`, `:63`, `:79` | Verify with GC logs on the reference tablet; likely delete | S |
| E17 | ~~26 translation keys have two different English fallbacks~~. **Withdrawn:** already fixed, and `check_translation_key_conflicts.py` gates it per PR. The figure came from a historical comment in `translationmanager.cpp` | — | — | — |
| E18 | Opt-in effects repaint continuously: the CRT layer over the whole stack, CupFillView canvases at 30 Hz, the StrangeAttractor screensaver at 60 fps | `main.qml:1271-1272`, `CrtShaderEffect.qml:40-45`, `CupFillView.qml:125-258` | Cap at about 15 fps, or off, on low-end devices | S |

Measured package total for E1–E7: **about 58–70 MB of a 218.7 MB APK**, before E8.

### Already good, keep it
- Operation pages appear whoever started the operation (app or group head), and back is always bottom-left.
- The popup queue waits out the screensaver and ignores brief scale drops. One touch on the screensaver wakes both machine and scale.
- The review page autosaves with Undo. Grind picker wheels come from shot history. The shared profile picker shows "Recommended for <bean>" with reasons.
- Factory reset has two confirmation steps. Restore defaults to merge. The firmware update flow is clear.
- Accessibility discipline is strong (`AccessibleButton` everywhere, announced shot rows). The comparison graph tells shots apart by line pattern, not colour.
- The live shot graph is already off the QML per-sample path: FastLineRenderer with a 33 ms batched flush. Stop-at-weight decides on a worker thread and sends a high-priority event. Shot saves and history reads are on the database thread. Screensavers load on demand and pause when the app is suspended.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Muscle memory.** Removing the default double-tap and regrouping settings changes where things are. Mitigations: opt-in gesture overrides already exist, search reveals moved items, and the regroup happens once, with the manual updated in the same PRs.
- **Hiding advanced items.** Community members who help others say "go to X". Mitigations: the switch is remembered, search always reaches advanced items, and the manual names the switch.
- **Not loading on Edit (B5).** Some users may rely on Edit also selecting the profile. The editor's existing Try action covers that explicitly.
- **Light theme.** Fixing it touches the shared theme engine. The existing contrast tests should be extended to the graph colours rather than relied on as they are.
- **Packaging excludes (E1, E5, E6).** A stray style import or plugin dependency fails only at runtime. Mitigation: open every page once on the trimmed APK, and add a CI step that lists the APK and fails if an excluded library reappears or a required one is missing.
- **Dropping FFmpeg on Android (E4)** removes video screensavers there. Users who chose one fall back to images. This needs the maintainer's call (open question 7).
- **Lazy loading (E10, E11)** must stay synchronous (`asynchronous: false`). Asynchronous incubation was removed after crash reports (`SettingsPage.qml:250-255`, #720).

## Open Questions

1. Is "Coffee (bag) / Gear / Profile / Recipe" acceptable as the user-facing model, keeping "bag" as the item noun and making the recipe the only home of dose, yield, temperature and grind (B3)?
2. Should a fresh install get a starter recipe built from the default profile (A6)?
3. What should the post-shot review's default auto-close be (A9)?
4. Should the advanced tier be one global switch, or per tab (C2)?
5. Should Edit stop loading the profile onto the machine (B5), leaving Try/Save to load it?
