// The contract between a page and the application shell.
//
// Pages used to reach main.qml's root object directly, by the names it happens to
// declare — a bare "root dot goBack", "root dot stopReason". That works only because
// StackView creates each page with main.qml's context, so the id is found at runtime
// by name lookup. It made 120 call sites across 26 page files invisible to qmllint,
// qmlcachegen and the language server: a misspelled member is indistinguishable from
// a correct one until a user hits it, and a member main.qml does not have at all is
// never flagged. ScreensaverPage's RSS ceiling sat broken that way for months,
// comparing against `undefined` on every video transition.
//
// So the shell surface is declared here instead, where it is a real type.
//
// NAVIGATION IS SIGNALS, NOT FUNCTIONS. main.qml owns the StackView and keeps
// every line of the navigation logic — the `startNavigation()` re-entrancy guard,
// how operation pages are entered and left — because that is the most delicate
// code in the app and moving it here would buy nothing. A page
// states what it wants; the shell decides how. That also means a page can be loaded
// and reasoned about without main.qml existing at all.
//
// STATE IS OWNED HERE, NOT MIRRORED. The properties below have exactly one owner.
// main.qml reads and writes them like any other participant, rather than declaring
// its own copy — two owners of one flag is how they drift.
//
// What deliberately did NOT move here: `cleanForSpeech()` lives on
// AccessibilityManager, where a screen-reader text helper belongs and where it can
// be unit-tested. Do not let this file become the place everything global lands —
// that is the flat-`Settings` mistake the project already had to reverse.
