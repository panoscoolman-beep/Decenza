// This lives in a singleton rather than in CustomItem because it now has TWO kinds of
// caller: the Custom widget, and the ten built-in action widgets whose gestures a user can
// override (layout-widget-gesture-overrides). Those built-ins render two ways — compiled to
// CustomItem in the center/action zones, and as their own items/<Type>Item.qml elsewhere —
// and the second kind cannot reach a function that lives on CustomItem. Copying the
// dispatch into them was the alternative, and a copied 170-line switch is the drift shape
// this codebase keeps paying for.
//
// `ctx` carries what the dispatch cannot look up for itself: `idlePage`, needed by
// togglePreset to find the preset row. Callers that have no IdlePage ancestor pass nothing
// and togglePreset warns, exactly as before.
